### Please follow these instructions to set up directory structure for the workshop

- [x] Download SCW.zip: [Link](https://github.com/uta-carpentries/SWC_Fall2019/raw/master/SCW.zip)
- [x] Unzip and add `SCW` folder to Desktop.

The folder `SCW` should contain the following folders:
```
Data  
Data_Copy  
Lesson1_UnixShell  
Lesson2_IntroToR  
Lesson3_Git_GitHub  
Lesson4_ProgrammingR  
Lesson5_DataVisualizationR  
Lesson6_ReproducibleResearchR
```

`Data` and `Data_Copy` contain datasets that will be used during this workshop. 
`Data_Copy` should be used in case you accidentally delete files in `Data` folder.
`Data_Copy` is a backup data folder, it is always a good practice to keep your original raw data in a separate 'safe' folder.
